### Result
##### 1) Ripening detection using YOLOv5 </p>
   After training even virtual images generated by GAN, mAP0.5 showed excellent performance with 0.976. </p>
##### 2) Disease detection using YOLOv5 </p>
   As a result of comparing the mAP0.5 of the YOLOv5,6,8 models, the mAP0.5 value of YOLOv5 was the best at 0.991.
