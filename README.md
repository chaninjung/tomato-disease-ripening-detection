### Result
#### 1) Ripening detection using YOLOv5 </p>
![f1ripening](https://github.com/chaninjung/tomato-disease-ripening-detection/assets/156671303/9043f2b1-8438-444f-9c6d-40257527abd6) </p>
The graph above is the F1-SCORE curve related to the confidence level of YOLOv5 after GAN application. At 0.481 confidence level, the F1-SCORE of all classes reached a maximum of 0.94. </p>
After training even virtual images generated by GAN, mAP0.5 showed excellent performance with 0.976. </p>
#### 2) Disease detection using YOLOv5 </p>

The graph above is the F1-SCORE curve associated with the confidence level of the Phase YOLOv5 model. At the 0.571 confidence level, the F1-SCORE of all classes reached a maximum of 0.96. </p>
As a result of comparing the mAP0.5 of the YOLOv5,6,8 models, the mAP0.5 value of YOLOv5 was the best at 0.991.
